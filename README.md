### Hi, I'm Spencer ðŸ‘‹

![Head image](/images/github-head-01.png)

Iâ€™ve always had a DIY spirit. I love making things *work*.  

As a software engineer with a background in Marketing and Project Management, I strive to build elegant, functional solutions to common and uncommon problems with a focus on intuitive, user-friendly resolutions that deliver results.

I specialize in bringing a calm to the storm of business with my unflappable nature and years of experience with customer service, process improvement, problem-solving, and client-first solutions.

Check out [my Portfolio](https://spencerhaugh.dev) here, and definitely send me any feedback you have! (I built it myself, of course!)
