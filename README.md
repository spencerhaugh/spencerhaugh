### Hi, I'm Spencer ðŸ‘‹

![Head image](/images/github-head-01.png)

Iâ€™ve always had a punk rock DIY spirit. I love making things *work*.  

I have been working full time as a full stack developer since late 2021.

As a software engineer with a previous career background in marketing & customr support, I understand user pain points, and strive to build solutions with a focus on resolutions that just feel intuitive, and good to interact with as a user, and ultimately deliver more value to the user and to the project.  

Check out [my Portfolio](https://spencerhaugh.dev), and please send any feedback you have! I built it to be fun to interact with, so let me know if you think it is!  


## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...  

Leveling up at my first dev job! I'm working really hard on that, which has started off with a bang learning Angular and Typescript on the job, and is now moving into learning NestJS on the backend as well! I'm continuing to build personal projects, and just focusing on becoming a better resource for my company and dev team.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...  

Angular! This is a framework that, frankly, has always intimidated me. But I am conquering both NestJS on the backend and Angular on the frontend, as both are needed in my current role!

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...  

I excited about continuing to strengthen my Angular knowledge, I'm always excited about React projects, and am building some side projects with NextJS and SSR. I'm very curious to mess around with Game Dev and C# someday. As always, I'm always open to ideas. Give me a shout!
