### Hi, I'm Spencer ðŸ‘‹

![Head image](/images/github-head-01.png)

Iâ€™ve always had a DIY spirit. I love making things *work*.
I love creating solutions for myself, for clients, and for my employer! And, I love creating beautiful products.

As a software engineer with a background in Business Development and Project Management, I strive to build elegant solutions to common and uncommon problems with a focus on intuitive, user-friendly resolutions, that deliver results.

I specialize in bringing a calm to the storm of business with my unflappable nature and years of experience with process improvement, problem-solving, and client-first solutions.
