### Hi, I'm Spencer ðŸ‘‹

![Head image](/images/github-head-01.png)

Iâ€™ve always had a punk rock DIY spirit. I love making things *work*.  

I have been coding daily since 2020, and working full time as a full stack developer since 2021.  

As a software engineer with a previous career background in marketing & customer support, I understand user pain points, and strive to build solutions with a focus on resolutions that just feel intuitive, and good to interact with as a user, and ultimately deliver more value to the user and to the project.  

Check out [my Portfolio](https://spencerhaugh.dev), and please send any feedback you have! I built it to be fun to interact with, so let me know if you think it is!  


## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...  

I'm continuing to build personal projects, one I recently wrapped up is [Poorly Drawn Pokemon](http://www.poorlydrawnpokemon.com), which I made to play around with NextJS, and just to see what headless CMS platforms were like to work with. But mainly, I am always just trying to learn new things, and become a better resource for my company and dev team.   


## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...  

Angular and NestJS! I am conquering both NestJS and Angular at the moment. NestJS on the backend as we migrate from Express, and Angular on the frontend. I do really enjoy working in Typescript, so these are fantasic frameworks to be working in!  
I'm also taking Computer Science courses at Harvard DCE, and also messing around in my freetime with Java and Python applications.


## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...  

Anything bicycle-related! :bike:  
Outside of programming, I am a pretty big bike nerd, and I even have a fairly popular podcast all about the sport. (The Slow Ride Podcast, check it out!)
