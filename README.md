### Hi, I'm Spencer ðŸ‘‹

![Head image](/images/github-head-01.png)

Iâ€™ve always had a DIY spirit. I love making things *work*.  

As a software engineer with a background in marketing, I strive to build elegant solutions to common and uncommon problems with a focus on intuitive resolutions that just feel good to interact with as a user.  

I specialize in bringing a calm to the storm of business with the unflappable nature of my personality, and many years of experience with customer service, process improvement, problem-solving, and client-first solutions.  

Check out [my Portfolio](https://spencerhaugh.dev), and please send any feedback you have! I built it to be fun to interact with, so let me know if you think it is!

Leveling up at my first dev job! Working really hard on that, which includes learning Angular and Typescript on the job. I'm continuing to build on my portfolio projects, and just focussing on becoming a better resource for my company and dev team.

Angular! This is a framework that, frankly, has always intimidated me. But I am conquering both Typescript and Angular as both are needed in my current role!
